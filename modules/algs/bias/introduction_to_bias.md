# Introduction to Bias: Discussion Questions

1. What are some examples of machine learning systems you encounter in your daily lives?  Pay attention to whether they are “visible” (the user knows there is an algorithm making recommendations/decisions) vs. “invisible” (it’s not obvious to a regular person that there’s ML going on in the background).

2. Can you think of any examples in which the recommendations/behavior/output of a machine learning system influenced decisions that you made?

3. Give some examples of applications where you think it’s appropriate for an algorithm to make decisions, and some examples where it may not be appropriate.  What separates the two categories?

4. One of the great powers of machine learning is that modern algorithms are able to find patterns that we humans can’t even understand, much less find on our own.   If we require interpretability, transparency, etc., are we limiting the power of ML by too much?

5. Some of the common themes we’ve seen (and will continue to see) are consent and transparency: do people agree to have their data used, and is it clear how it is being used.  Are there ever any situations where consent and transparency are not enough?  That is, even if people understand and agree to how their data is being used by a model, application of that model is still unethical?

6. One of the arguments we saw in the readings is that bias can enter a ML system when one is choosing how to define features.  Some features are easy to define (e.g., height, full-time employed, etc.), but others are more subjective: for example, determining whether a past individual was a “good” employee, or if you are converting a feature with continuous values to a binary feature (e.g., converting height to short/tall).  Can you come up with some real-world examples of this that may cause ethical problems, other than those mentioned in the article?  

7. Suppose a university admissions committee is using a ML algorithm to help make decisions about which students to admit.  How could you design an ethical ML system?  Think not only about the data and algorithm itself, but also how it is used.  

8. We’ve seen many examples related to bias and discrimination by ML systems.  But many of these things can (and do!) occur even without ML!  At this point, what do you see as the major ethical issues introduced by use of ML?
