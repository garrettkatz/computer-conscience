# Correcting Bias: Discussion Questions

1. We’ve seen the idea of audits, which retroactively look at a decision-making sequence to determine whether any unethical bias was present.  What could such an audit look like?  Think about who would perform the audit, what kind of data they’d need, and what the outcome of the audit could look like.

2. We’ve talked a lot about problems, but what are the major solutions that you see at this point?  Who (and at which levels) is responsible for implementing them?   Think in terms of broad categories of solutions (like “transparency”), as well as specific, concrete solutions (like the “Choose your own adventure” application for credit scoring).

3. In the introduction to the paper by Corbett-Davies, et al., the authors bring up the ProPublica vs. Northpointe debate about how to measure fairness.  They mention three types of fairness: “Statistical parity”, in which members from each race group are detained at the same rate; “Conditional statistical parity,” in which members from each race group are detained at the same rate after controlling for ‘legitimate’ risk factors like past criminal history; and “Predictive equality,” in which the accuracy of decisions is equal across groups.  Discuss the merits and drawbacks of each of these standards.
