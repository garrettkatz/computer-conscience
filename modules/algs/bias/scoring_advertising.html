# Scoring and Advertising: Discussion Questions

1. Citron and Pasquale list three problems with credit scoring: Opacity, arbitrary assessments, and disparate impact.  Would you add anything to this list?

2. Citron and Pasquale break the scoring process into four steps: (1) Data collection, (2) Computing scores, (3) Disseminating the scores to decision-makers, and (4) Using the scores to make decisions.  What should the rights of scored individuals be at each of these four steps?

3. At one point, the paper argues that before uniform, nationwide scoring systems, individual loan officers made creditworthiness decisions.  One advantage of this was that the system as a whole was more community-focused, and more resilient against sudden changes in the system (e.g., the economy crashing).  But there are obvious downsides to this, like bias by individual loan officers.   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of making creditworthiness discussions in a distributed fashion (by individuals) vs. a centralized fashion (a uniform credit score).

4. Two arguments for why discrimination is bad included social segregation and stigmatization, but the author pointed out that these harms are context specific.  What are some scoring-related applications in which these harms are most concerning?  When are they less concerning?

5. Discrimination in online advertising could potentially be addressed at different levels, including the government, the companies bidding on ads, or the company displaying the ads (e.g., Google Ads). 

    1. Assume that the government cannot prohibit discriminatory online advertising (due to free speech concerns), but wants to provide some incentive or disincentive to reduce such advertising.  For example, the Childrenâ€™s Internet Protection Act requires that schools and libraries receiving federal funding use Internet filters to protect children from harmful online content.  Is there any way they could accomplish this?  How would they identify discriminatory online advertising?  Who should they target?  

    2. Assume that the company displaying the ads is using a real-time auction mechanism, like was described in the paper.  Suppose that the company wants to reduce discrimination in online advertising.  How could it accomplish this?
